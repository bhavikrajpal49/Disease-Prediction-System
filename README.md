# Disease Prediction System

Sometimes we need immediate medical attention, but for some reason they are not available. In our project we propose a user-friendly system to get guidance on health issues quickly through an online health care system.And predicts disease based on symptoms user is suffering from using Machine Learning.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Python Tkinter  

**Backend:** MySql

**Libraries:** Tkinter, Turtle, Pandas, Numpy

**IDE:** Vscode   


## Functionality

### Patient Module Patient Login: - Patient login into the system using their ID and password. 
### Patient Registration: -If the patient is a new user they will enter their information and will receive an ID and password that can log in to the system. 
### Disease Prediction: - The patient will clarify the symptoms caused by his illness. The program will ask specific questions about the illness and then predict the disease according to the patient's symptoms and the program will also identify the disease-based doctors.
